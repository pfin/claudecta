# The Turtle Trading System: Complete Reference

## Origin and Background

The Turtle Trading system is one of the most famous trading experiments in financial history. In 1983, renowned commodities trader Richard Dennis made a bet with his partner William Eckhardt about whether successful trading could be taught or if it was an innate talent. Dennis believed that trading success was based on following specific rules, while Eckhardt thought it required natural ability.

To settle the argument, Dennis recruited novice traders through advertisements in major financial publications. He selected trainees from diverse backgrounds, including a security guard, an actor, and recent college graduates - none with significant trading experience. These traders became known as the "Turtles," a name inspired by Dennis's visit to Singapore turtle farms where he observed how turtle farmers grew thousands of turtles in small tanks.

In January 1984, Dennis trained the recruits for just two weeks, providing them with a specific set of trading rules. He then gave them trading accounts ranging from $250,000 to $2 million of his personal capital. Over the next five years, these traders collectively earned approximately $175 million, with some individual traders generating returns of over 100% per year.

The experiment conclusively proved Dennis's thesis that trading could be taught, and the Turtle Trading system has since become one of the most studied trading methodologies in the financial industry.

## Complete Turtle Trading Rule Set

### Market Selection

The Turtles primarily traded liquid futures markets across several categories:

1. **Currencies**: British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Deutsche Mark, French Franc, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc
2. **Commodities**: Coffee, Cocoa, Sugar, Cotton
3. **Energies**: Crude Oil, Heating Oil, Unleaded Gas
4. **Metals**: Gold, Silver, Copper
5. **Financials**: Treasury Bonds, Eurodollars
6. **Stock Indices**: S&P 500, Nikkei

The Turtles avoided markets with lower liquidity such as meats and grains, as these markets could be more difficult to enter and exit with large positions.

### Entry Systems

The Turtles used two different entry systems:

#### System 1 (S1): Short-Term System
- Enter long when the price exceeds the 20-day high
- Enter short when the price drops below the 20-day low
- This system generated more frequent signals and smaller average profits per trade

#### System 2 (S2): Long-Term System
- Enter long when the price exceeds the 55-day high
- Enter short when the price drops below the 55-day low
- This system generated fewer signals but larger average profits per trade

Breakouts were calculated using the closing prices, and entries were executed at the market open on the following day or using a limit order at the breakout price.

### Position Sizing

Position sizing was perhaps the most critical aspect of the Turtle system. It was designed to normalize risk across different markets regardless of their price or volatility.

#### Step 1: Calculate N (Average True Range)
N represents the average daily volatility of a market in dollar terms. It was calculated as the 20-day exponential moving average of the true range:

True Range = Maximum of:
- Today's High - Today's Low
- Today's High - Yesterday's Close (absolute value)
- Today's Low - Yesterday's Close (absolute value)

#### Step 2: Calculate Unit Size

```
Unit Size = 1% of Account / (N Ã— Dollar Value per Point)
```

This formula ensured that each unit represented approximately 1% of the account equity in terms of risk.

#### Step 3: Apply Position Size Limits

- **Maximum 4 units per market**: Prevented overexposure to any single market
- **Maximum 6 units per closely correlated markets**: Limited exposure to similar markets (e.g., currencies or energies)
- **Maximum 10 units per loosely correlated markets**: Limited sector exposure
- **Maximum 20 units total portfolio exposure**: Limited overall risk

### Stop Loss Rules

The Turtles used a simple but effective stop-loss approach:

- 2N stop from the entry price
- If adding units to a position (pyramiding), the stop remained 2N from the initial entry price
- Stops were not trailed; they remained fixed until the position was closed

### Exit Rules

#### System 1 (S1) Exits:
- Exit long positions when the price falls below the 10-day low
- Exit short positions when the price rises above the 10-day high

#### System 2 (S2) Exits:
- Exit long positions when the price falls below the 20-day low
- Exit short positions when the price rises above the 20-day high

### Pyramiding (Adding to Positions)

The Turtles would add to winning positions according to these rules:

- Add one unit at each 1/2N price movement in the direction of the trend
- Continue adding until the maximum position size was reached
- Each additional unit had the same stop loss point (2N from initial entry)

This approach allowed profits to be maximized in strong trends while maintaining the same risk management principles.

### System Allocation

Most Turtles traded a mix of both systems:
- 80% of capital allocated to System 2 (longer-term)
- 20% of capital allocated to System 1 (shorter-term)

This allocation balanced the need for consistent smaller gains with the potential for larger trend-following profits.

## Trade Management Principles

The Turtles followed several important trade management principles:

### 1. Systematic Execution

- All rules were followed without discretion or emotional decision-making
- Signals were taken regardless of fundamental news or market sentiment
- Performance was measured on full system implementation, not individual trades

### 2. Risk Management Focus

- Position sizing was considered more important than entry and exit timing
- Total portfolio risk was continuously monitored and controlled
- Drawdowns were accepted as a normal part of the trading process

### 3. Diversification

- Trading across uncorrelated or weakly correlated markets
- Balancing positions across different market sectors
- Using both System 1 and System 2 for time diversification

### 4. "Memory-Less" Trading

- Each trade was independent of previous trades
- Recent losses did not affect the decision to take the next signal
- No attempt to "make back" losses by increasing position sizes

## Performance and Analysis

### Historical Performance

During the original Turtle program (1983-1988), the system reportedly generated:
- Compound annual returns of 80%+ for the best performers
- Overall group returns averaging around 50% annually
- Drawdowns of approximately 10-15% during unfavorable periods
- Profits in both bull and bear markets across multiple asset classes

### Performance by Market Environment

The Turtle system performance varied considerably depending on market conditions:

- **Trending Markets**: Exceptional performance with potential for triple-digit annual returns
- **Choppy/Sideways Markets**: Significant drawdowns due to whipsaw losses
- **Crisis Periods**: Often excellent performance as trends tended to develop during market stress

### Psychological Challenges

Despite the system's mechanical nature, most Turtles reported that the psychological aspects were the most challenging:

- Accepting losses as part of the system
- Maintaining discipline during drawdowns
- Adding to positions when already holding large profits
- Not deviating from the rules based on opinions or news

## Legacy and Modern Adaptations

The Turtle Trading system formed the foundation for many modern trend-following approaches. Common adaptations include:

### 1. Entry Signal Enhancements

- Adding filters to reduce false breakouts
- Incorporating volume confirmation
- Using multiple timeframe analysis for confirmation

### 2. Advanced Position Sizing

- Volatility-based position sizing (beyond simple N calculation)
- Account growth-adjusted position sizing
- Correlation-weighted portfolio construction

### 3. Improved Exit Techniques

- Trailing stops based on ATR
- Time-based exits for non-performing trades
- Partial profit-taking strategies

### 4. Risk Management Refinements

- Dynamic risk allocation based on market regime
- Volatility-targeting approaches
- Drawdown-controlled position sizing

## Modern Relevance and Critique

Despite being developed in the 1980s, the core principles of the Turtle Trading system remain relevant for modern markets:

### Enduring Strengths

- Disciplined, rules-based approach
- Strong focus on risk management
- Proven effectiveness in trending markets
- Clear, systematic portfolio management

### Modern Challenges

- Increased market efficiency and competition
- Higher execution costs in some markets
- Shorter trend durations in modern markets
- Proliferation of algorithmic trading strategies

## Conclusion

The Turtle Trading system represents one of the most successful systematic trading approaches ever developed. Its emphasis on position sizing, risk management, and systematic execution established principles that continue to influence quantitative trading today. While market conditions have changed since the 1980s, the fundamental insights about trend-following and risk management remain valuable for modern traders and investors.
